🛍️ Myntra Sales Data Analysis & Product Segmentation
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Product Segmentation on a scraped Myntra e-commerce dataset. The goal was to extract actionable business insights related to pricing strategies, discount patterns, brand performance, customer ratings, and product distribution.

The analysis transforms raw product-level data into meaningful insights using Python, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning techniques.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Analyze pricing and discount trends

Identify top-performing brands

Study customer rating distribution

Segment products using clustering techniques

Generate actionable business insights

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data Cleaning & Manipulation

NumPy – Numerical Operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data Visualization

Scikit-learn – K-Means Clustering

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Checked and removed duplicate records

Verified missing values

Structured dataset for analysis

2️⃣ Brand Analysis

Top 10 brands by product count

Average discount percentage by brand

Average ratings comparison

3️⃣ Price & Discount Analysis

Price distribution (Histogram + KDE)

Discount trend analysis

Correlation heatmap between numerical variables

4️⃣ Customer Insights

Top-rated products (minimum rating threshold applied)

Rating distribution analysis

Engagement based on number of ratings

5️⃣ Product Segmentation (Machine Learning)

Applied K-Means Clustering on:

Price

Discount Percentage

Created product clusters to identify pricing strategies

Performed price binning to categorize products into segments:

<1k

1k–2k

2k–3k

3k–5k

5k+

📈 Business Insights

Majority of products fall in the mid-range pricing segment.

Certain smaller brands maintain higher average ratings than major brands.

Discounts drive visibility but do not always correlate with higher ratings.

Popular categories show strong customer engagement.

Price segmentation helps identify optimal positioning strategies.
